    <h1> Efile tower</h1>
    <p> <b>Paris is located in northern France</b>, situated on the Seine River, serving as the nation's capital and the heart of the Île-de-France region, famous globally as a <i>center for art, fashion, culture, and gastronomy</i>. </p>

    <H2> Tower Power </H2>
    <p>The Eiffel Tower in Paris, France, has serious celeb status. Completed in <i>March 1889</i>, it's one of the most recognizable monuments in the world. And the site, which is also known as the Iron Lady, receives nearly seven millions tourists a year. But despite its fame, the tower has some monumental secrets. Get the lowdown on this Parisian highlight.</p>
    <H2>HIDDEN APARTMENT</H2>
    <p>If you were in charge of constructing the Eiffel Tower, where else would you live but ... the Eiffel Tower? Gustave Eiffel, who designed the landmark, built himself a small apartment on the top level of the structure. The sky-high hideaway had plush rugs, oil paintings, and even a grand piano. Only a few VIPs were allowed to visit, such as <i>superstar scientist Thomas Edison</i>. Unused since the 1920s after Eiffel's death, few knew about the <b>950-foot-high pad until 2015</b> when it opened for public viewing.</p>
    <H2>SKY LAB</H2>
    <p>The top of the Eiffel Tower seems like the perfect spot to study stars and weather. No wonder Eiffel set up two small laboratories on the third level where astronomers and meteorologists could work. Eiffel conducted his own experiments as well. To learn more about how objects move against air, he dropped items attached to cords from the second level of the tower <i>(about 380 feet above ground)</i> and observed how they fell.</p>
    <H2>Green Scene</H2>
    <P>Maybe this landmark should be renamed the Eco Tower. In 2015 workers gave the Iron Lady an environmentally friendly makeover by installing two wind turbines on the second level of the structure. These devices convert wind into electricity for the tower's shops and restaurants. A system was also set up to collect and funnel rainwater into the tower's toilets.</P>

    <h2>FAIR FRENZY</h2>
    <p>The Eiffel Tower was <b>officially opened at the 1889 world's fair</b>. First held in London, England, in 1851, world's fairs showcased cutting-edge inventions, architecture, and art from around the globe. The events have revealed many "futuristic" inventions, including the Ferris wheel, the television, x-ray machines, and ice cream cones. The world's fair, which is now called an expo, is held every three years in a different city and country around the world.</p>
